# dz-1 this is my first work with github
I created an public repozitory on GitHub and started working with the project in a local folder, which I later synchronized with the Github account.
Then a second branch was added and pushed in pull request, which I merged (which should not have been done).
So afret I was forsed to create trird branch with changes that were pushed and pulled.
